### Hi there 👋

I'm Giacomo Ettore Rocco. I hold a degree in Computer Science from the University of Udine and a Master's degree in Data Science and Scientific Computing from the University of Trieste.

- 🔭 My master's thesis involved applying Reinforcement Learning and Advanced Programming techniques in a simulated environment. This research was conducted under the guidance of Professor Eric Medvet, who leads the Evolutionary Robotics and Artificial Life Lab at the university. 

- 🖥️ My primary interests lie in the fields of Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, Continuous Control, Advanced Programming, and Problem Solving. I'm passionate about leveraging these techniques to tackle complex challenges and develop innovative solutions.

- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/giacomo-ettore-rocco-a56b01170/. I'm always excited to connect with fellow professionals and collaborate on interesting projects.
